I was forced to jump of the edge of the treail for my safety.  I pursued the snowmobiler (followed) with my squad (pickup truck) east on Hwy 23 at low speeds.  The Glacial ridge treail runs parellel to Hwy 23 for a short distance.  I lost sight of the snowmobiler after about 2 miles due to topography, his snowmobiles speed and because the treail turned away from Hwy 23.  I ended my pursuit of the snowmobile.  I then drove to the intersection Hwy 23 & County Rd 6.  I turned North and drove to the intersection of the Glacial Ridge Trail and County RD 6.  At his point, I determined that the snowmobliler had gone through this intersection before I had gotten there.  Iverfied this by talking with some other snowmobilers that were West bound.  They confirmed that had seen a snowmobile that matched my description and that it was heading East at a high rate of speed.  ","BCA0000JAK2",12/3/2007 9:04:58,"No injury","no","2007"
