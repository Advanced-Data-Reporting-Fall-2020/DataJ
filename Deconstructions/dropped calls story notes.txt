dropped calls story from Ellen Gabler, Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel


So this is my fave every "quick CAR" story I did a few years ago.

Basically I just requested 8 months of "call center data" after hearing from people that their calls were never answered.  If you read through the story, you can see the bits of analysis. 

It was some time ago so i really can't remember exactly how I did it and I don't think I still have the data but I'll look quick. 

In summary though, I had to figure out what to request: number of calls; number of calls answered; number of calls dropped. 

And then also requested staffing numbers and unemployment claims made throughout all of the 8 months I was examining. 

It was a fun story and one that made a big difference to a lot of people.
