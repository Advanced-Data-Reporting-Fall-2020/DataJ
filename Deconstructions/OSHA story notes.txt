The data we used was from OSHA's Fatality and Catastrophe Investigation Summaries, or "Form 170." That information gets dumped online here: http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/accidentsearch.html. I then used the search to filter down to our state offices. Then pulled that information into an excel sheet (by hand since there weren't many, though if I were more confident in scraping skills I would have done that). The main question we were after was, "how much do companies pay" so that was an easy answer with an average function in excel. A limitation with the data is it's two years old. Another issue we had to explain was how companies often get fined, but then appeal and pay much less than originally levied. We used the final paid number.

We also wanted to know if there were repeat offenders, so we were able to ask the data through a pivot table which company had the most fatalities. Since we were preparing the data for multiple newspaper markets, I was also able to filter some of the regions and blast out slices of the data.

A few tips: the regional OSHA press contacts are actually very helpful. For us it was two people in Chicago that are experts at media inquiries, and responded promptly to a string of probably 50 emails. As with other stories, the details of many of these cases tell the story, and a mountain of information is available if you request it. The first OSHA document for fines is usually the "Citation and Notification of Penalty" which includes all the reasons the fatality could have been prevented, and a dollar amount. Then after the company meets with OSHA, they issue an "Informal Settlement Agreement" which shows how and why they companies get out of paying big fines. I also found it helpful to request coroner's reports, fire department records and 911 audio from the mishaps.
