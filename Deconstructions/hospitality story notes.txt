Hospitality story
This story was a data reporter’s dream. Two independent sources of data — tax collections and the jobs report — told the same story, and it was a surprising story: part of the state’s economy, which is the second worst in the country by one measure, was doing pretty well. It didn’t hurt that the president picked the week we did the story to talk about the very same topic.

Every month, I get and look at tax collection data for the hospitality industry — our fourth largest employer in Rhode Island, as well as employment reports. With Excel, it’s real easy to compile these in one place going back more than a decade and create graphs of what the numbers have been doing over that time.

While the graphs for most sectors of Rhode Island’s economy since the start of the recession didn’t look very good, hospitality was on the upswing. Instant story!

By the key journalistic question was: why? If people are losing jobs and making less, why are they spending more eating at restaurants?

Here, an expert voice was key. The president of the convention and visitors bureau had the perfect answer: the rest of the country was on the mend, meaning people elsewhere could afford to come and spend their money in Rhode Island, which has long had a thriving tourism and convention business.
