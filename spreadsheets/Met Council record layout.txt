Here are some code translations and other information you might need to know about this data:
MTRAN --Metro Transit
RGADM--Regional Administration
ENVSR --Environmental Services
 
Metro Transit and Environmental Services are Met Council’s two big operating units. Metro Transit has a fleet of 830 buses and 27 light rail vehicles that serve 113 routes and provide about 250,000 rides per weekend. Environmental Services has eight regional plants and 600 miles of regional sewer that collect and treat some 300 million gallons of wastewater per day from more than 100 metro area communities.
 
For the purposes of this payroll listing, Regional Administration includes all of Met Council’s central and support services, as well as the Community Development Division (local-regional planning, regional parks planning and Metro HRA) and the Metropolitan Transportation Services Division (which includes operating Metro Mobility, overseeing a number of contracted transit routes, and transportation planning).

It also includes the salaries of the 16 council members, who are elected officials and get paid a flat salary, regardless of the hours they work.

Salaries for non-elected employees are broken down by base pay, overtime pay, recognition pay and payout. Recognition pay would be from awards (years of service, employee of the month, etc). Payout primarily consists of pay for accumulated vacation and leave when an employee leaves the agency and/or pay for unused floating holidays as provided for in contracts with several of the bargaining units.
