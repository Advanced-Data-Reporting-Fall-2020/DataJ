Use this database: http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=258&DB_Short_Name=Air Carriers
 
Set the Filter Geography dropdown to Minnesota.  The most recent month is July so use that for the Filter Period. July will give you a big spreadsheet.  All Months would give you a very big spreadsheet.
 
Check Passengers, Leave the two checks under Carrier, uncheck Origin Airport ID, check OriginCityName, uncheck Dest Airport ID, check DestCityName.  Check Service Class at the bottom.
 
Download – you’ll get your big Excel.  First, sort by Service class and eliminate all but F class – scheduled passenger service.
 
Then you want to sort for route and carrier.  I’d suggest creating a duplicate.  Sort one by origin and Unique Carrier, sort the second by Dest and Unique carrier.  Then you can calculate the total passengers by route and the passengers for each airline. It will be mostly MSP but there might be a few other Minnesota airports that you’ll want to delete.
 
Let me know if you need anything else.  Please credit the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.
