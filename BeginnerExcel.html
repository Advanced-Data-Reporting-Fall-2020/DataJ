		<p>This tipsheet is specific to Microsoft Excel (2007 and newer) for Windows, however other spreadsheet software - such as Google Sheets - have the same functionality. Of course, the buttons and specific ways to do things might be different. But I often find answers by doing a web search using the Excel terms (i.e. how to format cells in Google Sheets). Excel for Mac has all the same functions, but looks slightly different, especially in terms of where buttons and various tools are stored.</p>

		<h3>Looking around Excel</h3>
		<p>This tutorial uses a spreadsheet called <a href="http://mjwebster.github.io/DataJ/spreadsheets/MLBpayrolls.xls" target="_blank">MLBPayrolls</a></p>
		<br>
		<p>First, a few things about spreadsheets: Each sheet is made up of columns (labeled by letters) and rows (labeled by numbers). Each cell is identified by a cell address, consisting of the letter and number. For example, in this picture, the value Atlanta Braves is stored in cell A3. Note that when the cursor is on a cell, the cell is outlined in black. Note the small black square in the corner -- we'll be using that in a couple minutes. Also note that the letter and number are highlighted in grey and the cell address is displayed in the upper left corner of the sheet. If you've ever played the board game, Battleship, you'll find this similar.</p>

		<p>You'll also notice that your cursor will change as you move it around. Most of the time, it will look like a big fat white plus sign. But if you hover over the top of the black box (around Atlanta Braves) you will get a tool that allows you to move that cell and if you hover in the lower right corner - where that little black square is - you will get a thin black cross. That thin black cross is used for copying formulas down or across the page. We'll be using that a lot.</p>

		<h3>Key terms</h3>
		<ul>
		<li><b>Columns</b> contain "categories" of data and are vertical</li>
		<li><b>Rows</b> contain invidivdual records and are horizontal</li>
		<li>A <b>cell address</b> consists of a letter followed by a number, i.e. "B4"</li>
		<li>Each Excel file is described as a <b>workbook</b> which can contain multiple <b>worksheets</b></li>
		<li>The <b>formula bar</b>, which is located in the menu bar, is similar to the address bar in a web browser. Here you can view and edit formulas that you've created in the worksheet.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Cursors</h3>

		<h3>Prepping your data</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Make sure the columns are labeled and that the column label only takes up one row.</li>
		<li>Any notes or titles --or anything else that might be above or below the data table -- should be separated from the data by a blank row (or more). Your data won't sort correctly if other information butts up against the table.</li>
		<li>No empty rows or empty columns within the area where the data is located.</li>
		</ul>
